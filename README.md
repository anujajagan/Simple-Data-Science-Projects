# Github Repo: Simple Data Science Projects #
## Hi Everyone! My name is Anuja Jaganathan. Welcome to my Github page :smiley: ##
The idea behind this repo is to demonstrate my ability to perform exploratory data analysis and visualization using Jupyter Notebooks and Python.
If you are a self-learner looking to do simple data science projects, please go ahead and explore.

 ### Some important information: ###
 
* This repository contains some simple data science projects that I work on. 
* The datasets are a mix of fictional and real world data. 
* This page is a work in progress and I will keep adding more projects and datsets as I keep working on them.
* For those of you who are new to programming in Python, please check out these (entirely free) resources:

    * [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/  "Superb site with hands-on training!")
    * [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw)
    * [Udemy-Data Science and Pandas](https://www.udemy.com/share/101DUs3@pPuLZCMif5A4YoVZqZ2tnSqrOLds_km18xXqhd7IOG3-MVNGmw_VRFsjQdwGa7GKJQ==/)
 
 I strongly recommend working through the "Data Science in Python" learning path in Dataquest.
 
 ## A little more about me ... 💁‍♀️ ##:

 When I am not creating projects here, I work as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvnia where I struggle to understand why human cells behave the way they do.
 I am interested, eventually, in using data science to provide healthcare solutions and improve healthcare in general, particularly focussing on underdeveloped and developing countries. For those of you not familiar with this field, it's called [Health Informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics).
